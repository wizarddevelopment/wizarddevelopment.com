# HS Box Scores NYC

Improving the core product and marketing efforts to engage a wider audience more often.

## Goals and Objectives

 - To provide ease of use and maintenance of site's operations
 - To improve site's traffic considerably

## Solution

### Phase 1 of Development (1 Week)

We'll ensure the site has no trouble staying up operationally. This includes securing access to accounts, checking plan limits, and addressing any technical issues. We'll build a CMS into your admin area so that you can update the site's content without needing code changes to the site. Additionally we'll add an analytics service (Mixpanel), address the spam account and the graphical issues around mobile and tablet use.

### Marketing and Social Media Planning

During Phase 1 you'll also meet with our marketing consultant on a social media plan. You'll receive a report that help you move forward with a content marketing strategy. This will include how you should use YouTube, Twitter and Facebook to better engage with both your audience and the communities they currently follow.

Additionally planning an opt-in mailing list for both updates to your site (and eventual blog) and allowing subscription to site features such as full score and highlights, score only, highlights only, pre-game and post-game write-ups, team news, conference or league news.

The analytics service will be available to measure the results of your different marketing efforts to gage their effectiveness.

We'll schedule a time a few weeks after you start to put some of these changes to work and check on their effectiveness and make adjustments. Ongoing consulting is also available.

### Phase 2 of Development (2 Weeks)

Based upon the the outcomes of your marketing planning. We can adjust the goals for this phase. Since the site will be running smoothly, we can concentrate on increasing the number of visitors.

It will likely include;
 - Designing and Buildings a Blog
 - Building a subscription email feature.
 - Embedding videos so they can be easily shared
 - Allowing scores to be shared on social media networks
 - Integrating with Facebook to share content and embed comments


## Engagement Details

Wizard Development works on a time and materials basis. We price projects at a per person, per week rate. The number of people needed determines the cost and how much gets done. We have a predictable schedule (4 days/week). We ask that someone with authority from the client be available 5-10 hours a week to work with our team to answer questions and give feedback. You'll always know what is happening via access to our project management system (Pivotal Tracker) and our chat room (Slack). We ask clients pay two weeks at the start of the project and bill weekly at the conclusion of each week afterwards with Net-15 Terms. Clients can pay via check, credit card, or wire transfer.
