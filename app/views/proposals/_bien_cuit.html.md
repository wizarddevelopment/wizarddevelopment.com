# BakeCycle Rewrite

Reducing costs with a secure, reliable and accurate bakery management system.

## Goals and Objectives

BakeCycle has a history of bugs and hidden issues which as only increased as the system has grown. The time and cost to find, mitigate, and fix these problems has also been increasing. A rewrite will be able to cull the tide of bugs, allow easier modifications such as new features and enable multiple bakeries to use the system.

Features BakeCycle needs to provide:
   - System Stability
   - Accuracy of Reporting and Invoicing
   - Flexibility in Order Management

## Solution

We proposes to rewrite BakeCycle from scratch with modern web technologies to make it easier to use and support. An emphasis will be placed on the order management features to allow it to properly support the business and be a trusted source of information for both accounting and printing recipes.

Additionally we will build it in a way so that other bakeries can easily make use of it so it may be sold to recoup development costs. Wizard Development will be available for ongoing support of Bien Cuit and other bakeries.

## Hosting and Support
Hosting costs will be under $500 a year depending on usage of other bakeries. This will include backups, monitoring, and operational support. These services will be provided by 3rd party vendors chosen by Wizard Development.

Ongoing support will be provided free of charge during the engagement. While not currently engaged Wizard Development can be available hourly or for a retainer with guaranteed availability.

## Engagement Details

Wizard Development works on a time and materials basis. We price projects at a per person, per week rate. The number of people needed determines the cost and how much gets done. We have a predictable schedule (4 days/week). We ask that someone with authority from the client be available 5-10 hours a week to work with our team to answer questions and give feedback. You'll always know what is happening via access to our project management system (Pivotal Tracker) and our chat room (Slack). We ask clients pay two weeks at the start of the project and bill weekly at the conclusion of each week afterwards with Net-15 Terms. Clients can pay via check, credit card, or wire transfer.

Starting on 10/20/14 we have 1 developer available at $2800 a week. We'll have additional developers and designers available in November if needed.

## Project Timeline

 - Project Planning and Kickoff 2 days
 - Skeleton Application with Core Sections (customers, recipes, products, orders, etc) ~5 Weeks
 - Order and Invoice Management ~3 weeks
 - Recipe Printing ~1 week
 - Invoicing, Packing Slip Printing ~2 weeks
 - Client Auditing and Quickbooks export ~1 weeks
 - Additional Bakery support ~4 weeks

## Proposed Features
This section explores the proposed features in broad strokes, during the engagement we'll explore the specifics of each feature allowing for feedback and modification before development begins and after it's ready for testing. You'll be able to see when development starts and finishes for each feature on our project management tool Pivotal Tracker.

### Users Management
The ability to create users, manage accounts (password, email, etc) and give them access to different areas of the system.

### Customer Management
The ability to manage customers, delivery locations, delivery and billing contact information.

### Recipe and Product Management
The ability to create recipes of ingredients tracking cost. Create products from recipes or prepackaged items. Set prices based upon quantity, date and customer.

### Order and Invoice Management
The ability to create standing and daily orders, invoice the orders, and modify existing invoices. Allowing for changing of quantities, application of credits or fees and other modifications to correct for shortages and shipping issues.

### Delivery Route Management.
The ability to create routes and have orders belong to routes.

### Printing of Recipes
The ability to print recopies adjusted for current orders and lead times.

### Packing Slips and Invoices
The ability to print a days orders as packing slips and invoices,  print daily totals for orders on each route and print a client list for a days orders.

### Invoicing and Quickbooks Export
The ability to export orders into quickbooks for invoicing. The ability to view a customers orders, and print individual orders.

### Auditing
The ability to view an audit log for changes in Users, Customers, Recipes, a customer's orders and invoices.

### Mobile Support
Functionality from a mobile device such as an iPhone or iPad. This will be baked in from the beginning by designing the site to be "Mobile responsive", allowing it to resize to fit small screens and still be usable. This does not include off line support or a mobile app.

### Multiple Bakery Support
The ability to create multiple bakeries in the system with their own private data, administrators, invoicing, etc. This also includes a bakecycle landing page for people to "sign up", and bakecycle admins that can access any bakery.

## Next Steps

To proceed with this project, you should do the following:
 - Accept the proposal as is or discuss desired changes
 - Finalize and sign the contract
 - Submit two weeks of payment

Once these steps have been completed we can kick off the project. Since we've been working together for a while and have the original system to work from, we can skip most of the usual planning and start getting to work. We can schedule a time to show you or someone from Bien Cuit the tools, the staging area, and other aspects of the project management.
