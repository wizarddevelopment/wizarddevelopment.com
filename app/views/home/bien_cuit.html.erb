<div class="proposal">
  <h1 id="bakecycle-rewrite">BakeCycle Rewrite</h1>
  <p>Reducing costs with a secure, reliable and accurate bakery management system.</p>
  <h2 id="goals-and-objectives">Goals and Objectives</h2>
  <p>BakeCycle has a history of bugs and hidden issues which as only increased as the system has grown. The time and cost to find, mitigate, and fix these problems has also been increasing. A rewrite will be able to cull the tide of bugs, allow easier modifications such as new features and enable multiple bakeries to use the system.</p>
  <p>Features BakeCycle needs to provide:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>System Stability</li>
  <li>Accuracy of Reporting and Invoicing</li>
  <li>Flexibility in Order Management</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
  <p>We proposes to rewrite BakeCycle from scratch with modern web technologies to make it easier to use and support. An emphasis will be placed on the order management features to allow it to properly support the business and be a trusted source of information for both accounting and printing recipes.</p>
  <p>Additionally we will build it in a way so that other bakeries can easily make use of it so it may be sold to recoup development costs. Wizard Development will be available for ongoing support of Bien Cuit and other bakeries.</p>
  <h2 id="hosting-and-support">Hosting and Support</h2>
  <p>Hosting costs will be under $500 a year depending on usage of other bakeries. This will include backups, monitoring, and operational support. These services will be provided by 3rd party vendors chosen by Wizard Development.</p>
  <p>Ongoing support will be provided free of charge during the engagement. While not currently engaged Wizard Development can be available hourly or for a retainer with guaranteed availability.</p>
  <h2 id="engagement-details">Engagement Details</h2>
  <p>Wizard Development works on a time and materials basis. We price projects at a per person, per week rate. The number of people needed determines the cost and how much gets done. We have a predictable schedule (4 days/week). We ask that someone with authority from the client be available 5-10 hours a week to work with our team to answer questions and give feedback. You'll always know what is happening via access to our project management system (Pivotal Tracker) and our chat room (Slack). We ask clients pay two weeks at the start of the project and bill weekly at the conclusion of each week afterwards with Net-15 Terms. Clients can pay via check, credit card, or wire transfer.</p>
  <p>Starting on 10/20/14 we have 1 developer available at $2800 a week. We'll have additional developers and designers available in November if needed.</p>
  <h2 id="project-timeline">Project Timeline</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Project Planning and Kickoff 2 days</li>
  <li>Skeleton Application with Core Sections (customers, recipes, products, orders, etc) ~5 Weeks</li>

  <h2 id="proposed-features">Proposed Features</h2>
  <p>This section explores the proposed features in broad strokes, during the engagement we'll explore the specifics of each feature allowing for feedback and modification before development begins and after it's ready for testing.
