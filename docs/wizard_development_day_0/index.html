.center[Planning Poker => "Work the Cards" => Retro]
---
class: blue
#Cards

Each "feature card" is a SMALL, TESTABLE, DEPLOYABLE feature that provides value to the USER. They are written as a user story.

As a USER I need a FEATURE so that I GET VALUE.

Clear purpose to feature, clear value to user, clear complexity to developer.

Starts when you click start, ends when you deploy

---
class: blue
# Planning Poker

Stories have been created with the clients during the project "Inception".

They are "groomed" with 1-2 developers to fill in the missing bits.

Everyone gets together to decide the technical complexity of the card. "Small", "Medium" or "Large". If we find any X-Large we break it up.

We sort the cards by Largest Value and Smallest complexity.

---
class: blue
# Work the Cards
 1. *Start* the next card
 2. Write a Cucumber Test around the feature
 3. TDD whatever it is you need to build to make it work.
 4. *Finish* Make a Pull request, and get someone to review your code.
 5. Merge to Master and deploy to staging *delivered*
 6. PM or Client will *Accept* or *Reject* the card!
 7. High Fives!
 8. *Start* the next card

class: blue
# Retro(spective)
At the end of each iteration we'll review what happened, how we feel, etc, and then set goals for the next iteration. There are a number of ways to lead this meeting. But they all have some common themes.

 - A new person leads it each time
 - End of day, with beers &amp;&amp; snacks
 - Review goals from the last retro
 - Be honest
