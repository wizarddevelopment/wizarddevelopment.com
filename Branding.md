# Branding Questions
## POSITIONING
Compared with other companies, what is your current positioning?

I'm cheaper, friendlier, can give more personalized service than larger shops. Compared to overseas and "enterprise" shops, I use the business value of software as the metric of success and focus of work as opposed to features or lines of code. I'm in NYC and will come to you but experienced with working remotely, and with existing teams.

## PURPOSE
What is your business? What is your purpose?

To build high quality software that provides business value. I believe this can be achieved through teaching business owners and developers the agile methodologies.

## MISSION
Beyond the economics, why do you do what you do? What is your mission?

To teach people how to build and discover what software they really need to improve their business and quality of life.

## CULTURE
What is the most distinctive thing you do or provide to support your and mission?

Providing an environment where everyone can teach (each other and clients) and has agency to do what they think is best. While having the firm available to help correct mistakes and improve upon our products and processes. 

## COMPOSITION
What is your current internal structure?

Me. I'm the product manager, account manager, and developer.

## PERSONALITY
What is your chosen style and manner?

I only accept water during business hours. I get very interested in how other business work, in how they're improving on what they have. I like the philosophy behind why we work and what we make. I like seeing others succeed. 

## CLIENT GOALS
What are five key goals over the next one/five years?

60 hour of billable time a week and one or two employees in the next year
5-10 employees each billing 30 hours a week with 10 hours of internal time

Learn and adapt from clients needs to refine my products (project management, developer team education, "rockstar type" consulting.)

Helping at least one startup from inception to success. (helping 5 in 5 years?)

Getting popular in a small business niche. (Doctors, lawyers, other professions)

Doing good work for the open source communities (paid or not)

## GROWTH
What are the greatest opportunities for the growth of your business and image?

I'm currently going to meetups, talking with small businesses, and tapping my network. 

## PROMISES
What promises do you make to your clients?

Transparency. I want them to be able to know what's going on if they chose to, so they feel comfortable trusting me with their time and money.

## CURRENT AUDIENCE
Who is your current audience? Who, when, where, why?

My "hacker" activities with nodebots, hackathons, meetups etc. Mostly startup or junior techies. Some established people. Roborooter.com (or rbrtr.com) is old but stagnent. Twitter acquaintances in the ruby and js communities. People seem to recognize my avatar and handle.

## AUDIENCE GOAL
Do you want another type of audience? Who would it be?

Small businesses (10-20 people) don't know who I am. I don't know how to find them besides word of mouth.

## PERCEPTION
How does your audience currently view your brand?

They view it as me. I'm this smart guy they know.

## DESIRED PERCEPTION
How you you want your audience to view your brand?

The smart people I've collected. The experience and expertise to build good products and teach about software development.

## COMPETITION
How are you different from your competition?

From the positioning question. "I'm cheaper, friendlier, can give more personalized service than larger shops." I'm also inexperienced, new, small. Without a website. Experience with large scale operations. Versatile. Without a portfolio. Smart.

## RESPONSE
What response/feeling do you want your target audience to take away with them?

That I can help them achieve their business dreams. That I can improve how they work beyond what they currently understand. That they can trust me.

## OBJECTIVE
What is the market objective?

Enough work to employ 5-10 people and take time to travel.

## Marketing Objective
I need a website, a name, a brand, business cards, a pitch, and some love.
